# OUT OF TOUCH THURSDAY!!!
This is small, fun script which will remind you every time whenever there is a Thursday!
## What does it do?
It will open "out of touch thursday" youtube video on your browser and spam colorful "IT'S OUT OF TOUCH THURSDAY" text
until script will be manually closed (either by closing window or CTRL+C).
## How to configure it?
1. Have Linux
2. Check permissions (script should have at least read+execute)
   - ```chmod 500 thursday.sh```
3. Have installed MPV (https://mpv.io)
   - If you don't want to install anything additional then uncomment your browser from the script (by default brave is uncommented)
5. Run script
   - I strongly suggest adding this script to startup to be always surprised whenever Thursday comes
## Startup setup (optional but recommended)
On **GNOME** desktop execute thursday_startup_setup.sh script in GNOME repo subfolder. Assuming repo is in your $HOME directory do the following
```bash ~/Thursday-script/GNOME/thursday_startup_setup.sh```
