# OUT OF TOUCH THURSDAY!!!
This is small, fun script which will remind you every time whenever there is a Thursday!
## What does it do?
It will open "out of touch thursday" youtube video on your browser and spam colorful "IT'S OUT OF TOUCH THURSDAY" text
until script will be manually closed (either by closing window or CTRL+C).
## How to configure it?
1. Have Linux
2. Have installed MPV (https://mpv.io)
   - If you don't want to install anything additional then uncomment your browser from the script (by default brave is uncommented)
4. Run script
   - I strongly suggest adding this script to startup to be always surprised whenever Thursday comes
## Startup setup (optional but recommended)
On Gnome desktop do the following
1. cd ~/.config
2. Check if you already have autostart folder. If you don't have it then create it.
   - mkdir autostart
4. Copy file GNOME/thursday.desktop file from this repo into your autostart folder
   - cp ~/Thursday-script/GNOME/thursday.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
